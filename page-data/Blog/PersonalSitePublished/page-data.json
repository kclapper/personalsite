The new website went up this past Saturday and I was working out small bugs and spelling errors through Sunday. While it doesn't have quite as many features as I originally intended and it doesn't look quite how I was hoping, it is still a far improvement over my last personal site. You can find my last site at <a href=\"https://kpuc1997.github.io/\">https://kpuc1997.github.io/</a> and compare it to my new site which is currently at <a href=\"https://kyleclapper.com/\">https://kyleclapper.com/</a> (in the future if/when I do another version of the site, it may be at a different URL and you can find it instead at <a href=\"https://kpuc1997.github.io/personalsite/\">https://kpuc1997.github.io/personalsite/</a>).</p>\n<p>I do like the new color scheme and for the most part I also like the layout. I'm a big fan of having the blog as well, mostly to act somewhat like a diary or journal. This blog is more for me than it is the reader. </p>\n<p>There are still improvements I would like to make at some point, I'll detail them here but I don't intend on working on them for a bit. Part of the reason I didn't get as much done on this as I was hoping was that my interest started to fade and there were other projects I wanted to turn my attention to. I will likely come back to work on the site at some point but I want to do other stuff first. </p>\n<h5>Pictures</h5>\n<p>The carousel on my home page has three rotating pictures in it. While this is nice, I would like to have better quality, more relevant pictures on my homepage. I don't have a lot of professional pictures of myself so this will just have to come in time. I like the idea of the homepage carousel having pictures from blog posts with links to the posts themselves. </p>\n<p>I also can't currently attach pictures to my blog posts. This would probably be the first thing I add if/when I come back to work on the site. I would like to be able to put pictures up of my projects and other activities related to the blog posts. It would also serve to make the blog posts layout a bit more attractive.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to add relevant pictures to my resume page as well, graphics on the whole could use some work. </p>\n<h5>About Me</h5>\n<p>I wanted to put in an about me page as well that detailed more about my personal life, such as my interests and hobbies. This page if it existed would probably also lack the relevant pictures I would want. </p>\n<p>The resume page I did put up has the basic information I want, however, it doesn't have a download link for a PDF of my resume. That is something I would like to add.</p>\n<h5>Layout / Design</h5>\n<p>In general I like the layout and design of the site. However, on certain pages like the resume page, I think it would be nice to make it a bit more interesting. Certain pages are a bit dull, like the resume page and blog posts. I would also like to do a custom KC logo for the top left corner of the page, as it stands its just the stock font KC in slightly bigger letters. The footer for the site could probably be better designed as well. It looks fine but it could definitely look nicer. </p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>I like the site how it stands. For now, it'll serve the purposes I wanted it too. While there is certainly a lot more I would like to do, this is a good base from which to work on. Some resume and contact information is there and I now have my own platform to write blog posts. I intend on coming back to add more features in the future but for now a break. If someone happened to read this, thank you.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 03, 2019","path":"/Blog/PersonalSitePublished","title":"New Website Published"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
