Gatsby has a development server that lets you see the client as you're building it with hot reloading, similar to how create-react-app works. My site was looking good using the development server however, when I went to test build the site, the static build process failed. Once Gatsby got to the point in the build process where it was generating HTML, it was failing with an error about one of Bootstrap's javascript files trying to update an unmounted component (and trying to illegally modify an undefined object). After searching through stackoverflow and other help forums looking at similar issues people were having, I still had no success in solving the problem. Eventually through the forums I ended up on a gatsby debugging help page. It suggested that you could have issues with javascript modules which require \"window\" to be defined during the build process. At first I passed on attempting their recommended solution to this issue, trying to find a simpler solution. However, after more failed attempts at fixing the issue, I went with the gatsby help page suggestion. It worked, which was great. It ended up being simpler than I thought too, I just added a conditional module import for the required boostrap javascript in the component that needed it. This way it only imported the module if \"window\" was defined. This let the build process succeed and the component that was affected still worked properly afterwards. I checked too, the component did need the bootstrap javascript to function properly so I'm glad I was able to figure it out.</p>\n<p>Overall, I still need to get pictures for the different pages of the website and I have yet to start on the Resume or About Me pages. I also need to fix the carousel on the Home page and some odd behavior with the blog archive on the blog page. Other than that, I'm happy with the progress so far. I would like to be further along, but I still think I can finish by the 25th. While the footer for the site doesn't look great, its low on my triage list so I'm going to consider it done enough for release unless I get everything else finished with more time to work on it. Other than adding a custom KC logo, I'm happy with the navbar for the site. I think for this release it'll be considered finished.</p>\n<p>I'm fairly happy with the blog page but there are a few things I might want to fix. If I get the time, I'd like to find a way to dynamically change the excerpt size based on the height of the of the blogFeature on the blog page. This way its a more consistent size and may be a bit more pleasing. I also want to try and spruce up the blog template for individual posts, just to make it a bit easier to read and more enjoyable to look at. I also need to incorporate pictures in the blog posts.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 20, 2019","path":"/Blog/SiteUpdate11202019","title":"Update on Personal Website"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
