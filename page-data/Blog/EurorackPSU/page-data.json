I want to build a custom diy eurorack synthesizer. It will be a modular synthesizer with 3.5mm cables patching different inputs and outputs between modules. Eventually, I will need to build VCOs, VCAs, filters, LFOs, and other modules, but first I need a power supply.</p>\n<p>The eurorack format is kinda a psuedo standard. There is generally good agreement between manufactures of eurorack modules, cases, and power supplies about what format the power delivery will take. My understanding is that there is usually +12V, -12V, and +5V rails delivered over a ribbon cable to each module.</p>\n<p>I've been working on making my own power supply for future diy eurorack modules. I didn't really want to deal with mains power since it can be dangerous and this is one of my first diy electronics projects. So in the interest of safety and making the project unique, I've opted to use USB-C power delivery for my synthesizer. </p>\n<p>There is a small USBC-PD <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T6LPP9W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">breakout board</a> you can get for like $16 which allows you (with the proper wall wort) to take 20V 5A power from a USB-C cable. My plan is to use this board and a series of switched mode regulators and linear regulators to get each of the voltages necessary for the PSU.</p>\n<p>Instead of using an inverting SMPS for the -12V rail, I plan on setting the SMPS up to use a virtual ground with 0V equating to the output of a 12V regulating stage. Doing this, I can use simpler components with makes designing the external components for each IC easier. Each supply rail will use a buck converter to get 2V above what the rail will supply, then a linear regulator to get to the final output voltage. This way, I get efficiency benefits of the buck converter with the smooth output of the linear regulator. The buck converter's feedback loops should help account for any effect on the virtual ground position by changes in load current draw as well. Usage of the buck converters minimizes the thermal load on the linear regulators too so I shouldn't have to worry too much about IC heating. At some point I'll check to make sure my components have an adequate thermal solution, but with the low voltage drop across the linear stages, I don't think it'll be too much of a concern.</p>\n<p>I'm learning to use KiCad so I can sketch out my schematic diagram and eventually layout a custom PCB for the components. Below is my circuit design so far. I'm sure I'll make changes to it before it's done but I think this is a good starting point. </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9f5b7cd4d06db56a811aeb1d1a6e4ad5/05cab/Delete%20Me.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 77.27272727272727%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"EuroPSU Schematic 12-15-2019\"\n        title=\"EuroPSU Schematic 12-15-2019\"\n        src=\"/static/9f5b7cd4d06db56a811aeb1d1a6e4ad5/f6e31/Delete%20Me.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9f5b7cd4d06db56a811aeb1d1a6e4ad5/e24f3/Delete%20Me.png 300w,\n/static/9f5b7cd4d06db56a811aeb1d1a6e4ad5/7aa3b/Delete%20Me.png 600w,\n/static/9f5b7cd4d06db56a811aeb1d1a6e4ad5/f6e31/Delete%20Me.png 1200w,\n/static/9f5b7cd4d06db56a811aeb1d1a6e4ad5/05cab/Delete%20Me.png 1650w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I've already gotten the components necessary for the buck converter stages, now my next steps are to layout parts of the design on a breadboard and make sure it works well enough.
