I'm gonna work on it this weekend and however much is done will be released. I'm getting to the point where there are other projects I want to work on, so I'm gonna deliver a minimum viable product and update it at some point in the future. </p>\n<p>I intend on putting together a basic resume page, if theres time I will also put together a basic About Me page. I don't think I'll get to the point where I can put pictures in the blog posts but I'm okay with that being a later update. </p>\n<p>While the color scheme of the site isn't perfect, I like it enough to be delivered, so I won't be updating it for this release. </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 30, 2019","path":"/Blog/SiteExtension","title":"Personal Website Extension"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
