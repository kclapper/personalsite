Ostensibly I was going to become at least a mildly competent web developer to assist in remaking the website for the student radio station. Our stations website was starting to age and we wanted some more features that more modern station websites had. Our site at the time had a webstream where you could listen to station from the internet, but as soon as you clicked on any other link on the page it stopped the stream.</p>\n<p>We decided that writing a single page react app would allow us to keep that stream going no matter what tab they were looking at on the site. Using react we hoped to streamline development to get a site finished in time for graduation. Unfortunately we did not finish the new site and after we graduated the station began using a WYSIWYG website builder. In hindsight that was probably the better decision because it was going to be easier for different generations of student leaders to administer over time. </p>\n<p>Regardless of our lack of success, I did leave the process with a better understanding of how to use the react framework to build a website and with a better understanding of web development in general. My new interest in web development lead to several small projects including a <a href=\"chart.kyleclapper.com\">site</a> that checks how high on the Billboard-200 albums an artist made it and a personal website to host my resume. </p>\n<p>The original version of my resume site was made quickly in a weekend when I was first learning react (and the MaterialUI UI component library). It was kinda dinky but it was responsive based on viewing device and had a download link for my resume. I didn't have a good picture of me at the time so it included a low-res picture of me in a salmon stripped shirt in front of a wall with sharpie drawn all over it. </p>\n<p>Fast forward to my first year having graduated from college and now I have renewed interest in rebuilding my personal website with a bit more effort and time behind it. This time around I have a ideas for what I want to do differently and what I want the site to look like.</p>\n<p>The original resume site had a blue and white colorscheme because that was the default color combination for the ui library I was using. This time around I intend to pick my own colors for the different components of the site and I intend to use Bootstrap 4 as my component library instead of Material UI. Bootstrap 4 has been around a bit longer and has a larger user base than Material UI. Being based around native HTML elements with just custom CSS, I think it may be simpler to use and at the very least will be a new learning experience. I plan on having a maroon/burgundy primary color with a dark olive gray secondary color. The light colors will be ever so slightly off-white. </p>\n<p>Instead of using create-react-app this time around I plan on using gatsby, the static site generator. There are a few reasons for this decision. I plan on deploying the site to github pages when its done, so the site will need to be entirely static anyway. I have a feeling static site generating with gatsby will be slightly more performant than doing an SPA with create-react-app. As well, development may be somewhat simpler. I will need to get used to using graphql, however, this is almost a pro just because I think it will be an interesting/useful skill to develop. URL routes will be must simpler than using something like react-router because its just normal html static files. </p>\n<p>On this new personal website I would also like to build some form of personal blog. Since I want to deploy to github pages, I won't be able to do something like using a backend with a templating engine to write blog posts online. So instead, I will use gatsby and rebuild/deploy the project everytime I make an edit to the blog posts. Gatsby should make this somewhat painless. There are plugins for gatsby which let it read in markdown files and programtically create web pages based on those files. My intention then will be to have every post be a markdown file that gets compiled at build time to a new webpage in the deployed project. </p>\n<p>I'm writing this post while working on the new site. I hope to write blog post updates on this project as it goes and they'll all be up when it finally gets deployed as feeder content for the blog. If anyone is reading this, thank you.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 11, 2019","path":"/Blog/MySite","title":"Building My Website"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
