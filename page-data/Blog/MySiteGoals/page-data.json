With many projects, they never feel like they're fully done. Whenever I would work on a sound engineering project for the student radio station, I would never feel like the piece was well and truly finished, I would just get to a point where I felt I couldn't make it any better. Similarly with the websites I've built in the past, it always feels like I could keep working and improving on it forever and still not feel like its 'Done'. So I will attempt to decide on a core set of features/design aspects that when completed will mark the project at present as finished.</p>\n<h3>Deliverables</h3>\n<p>This should be a minimal viable product for my website. I want a certain set of features and I want the site to look cohesive. Here is a list of the minimum deliverables I want for the initial deployment of my website. </p>\n<h5>Home page</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Carousel of pictures from my blog posts. With pictures automatically sized for consistency</li>\n<li>Preview of some blog posts</li>\n<li>Brief description of who I am</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Resume page</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>One or more download links for my resume</li>\n<li>My resume in website form, with visual style differences for each section of the resume</li>\n<li>Links to relevant blog posts or other websites in the different resume sections</li>\n<li>Pictures, there needs to be visuals to go along with the resume text</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>About Me page</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Should have distinctly different style from the resume page</li>\n<li>Must detail some of my personal experiences, like scouting and more information about student radio</li>\n<li>There should be links (if relevant) to related blog posts</li>\n<li>Should have a number of pictures</li>\n<li>In total should give a summary of my personal interests that are not work related</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Blog page</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Must have a large excerpt from the most recent blog post </li>\n<li>Must have a way to access all past blog posts in an organized manner</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Header</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Must have navigation links to all major pages (so not individual blog posts)</li>\n<li>Should have a custom KC logo which is also a link to the home page</li>\n<li>Must have a contact button </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Footer</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Must have basic work contact info</li>\n<li>Must have a small site map</li>\n<li>Must have copywrite info</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Colors</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>No more than 5 colors used throughout the site UI</li>\n<li>Colors should have a grammar about them. The different colors should be used in consistent ways throughout the UI</li>\n<li>Colors should go well together. All text must be easily readable</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Layout</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Must not feel cramped</li>\n<li>Should feel fairly modern and accessable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I work on the project I may refine this scope of work, with special attention paid to not accidentally growing the scope out of control. </p>\n<p>Every so often I also intend on making another post with updates crossing items off this list.</p>\n<h3>Deadline</h3>\n<p>I want there to be a rough deadline to finish the site. I feel having an internal deadline will help keep me motivated to get the site done promptly. </p>\n<p>I have a tendency sometimes to get excited about a project and either rush through it or eventually abandon it. With this site I want to make sure I take my time, but that I don't give up. I'm hoping having the deadline will help in that regard.</p>\n<p>That being said, the deadline for initial deployment of the new website is:</p>\n<h4><center>November 25<sup>th</sup>, 2019</center></h4>\n<p>This is a day under two weeks from now. This should be enough time to finish. The site already has a good amount of progress on it and I'll have two weekends to get some concerted progress in. One of the challenges, I think, will be sourcing or taking pictures for the site. There are not a lot of pictures of me out there that I feel would work well on this website. I may have to get together with some friends of mine and have pictures taken specifically for this project. Regardless, I'm looking forward to working on it. </p>\n<hr>\n<p>These blog posts are mostly for me. Its nice to be able to get my thoughts written out and to have things like these deliverables documented. That being said, thank you for reading.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"November 12, 2019","path":"/Blog/MySiteGoals","title":"Setting Goals for my Website"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
