			When it comes to the length of your report, there's no requirement, but if you only write
			1 or 2 sentences you probably haven't written enough. The goal of the report is to demonstrate
			that you took the time to complete this project and understand the code you wrote. Show that
			you took the time to thoughtfully consider the project.


			<h4>Approach</h4>
			Like I said, you want to demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the problem. In your approach
			section, don't simply summarize or reiterate the project instructions. You want to try and do
			more than recount <em>what</em> you did, you want to try and explain <em>why</em> you did it that
			way. 

			<h4>Issues and Resolution</h4>
			For your Issues and Resolution section, be <em>specific</em> and <em>detailed</em>. State the
			exact errors that came up for you. Thoroughly explain why you were 
			getting the errors and what exactly you had to change in your code to fix them. If it wasn't an
			error you were getting, but improper output, then explain what kind of output you were getting,
			what in the code was causing it, and what you changed to fix it. If you weren't able to resolve
			the issue, you can still write a good Issues and Resolution section. Clearly explain what the 
			issue was, what you think was causing it, and what you tried to fix it. You could also speculate 
			about what the solution might look like, even if you weren't able to quite get it.
