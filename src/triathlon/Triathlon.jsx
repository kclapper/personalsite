                   <p>
                     Huge thank you to everyone who came out and to everyone who's supported me through
                     this endeavor. I might not have expressed it to everyone, but this race was really
                     important to me and your words of encouragement and support were a real boon. Towards
                     the end of the run I almost cried at the thought that I was actually going to finish,
                     and that there'd be people at the finish line (and remote) waiting to celebrate with me.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     This was my first olympic distance triathlon and it took a lot of
                     work to get here. The race was hard but I'm incredibly proud. I've dealt with
                     several injuries and set-backs over the last two years and I'm grateful
                     to come away from this race feeling exhausted but healthy. We'll see how I feel tomorrow
                     morning, but today I'm just glad my knees and hips appear to be in one piece.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     Again, thank you everyone. It means a lot üôÇ

                   <p>
                     Huge thanks to Emily and the wonderful people at Bay State Physical Therapy in Beverly!
                     Without them I'd still be in a whole lot of pain and I certainly wouldn't be able to do this
                     race. Thank you to Jen for letting me borrow her shirt to race in. You'll get it back freshly
                     laundered, I promise.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     If you're in need of physical therapy I can't recommend these people enough. They're fantastic
                     to work with and incredibly helpful.
                   </p>
